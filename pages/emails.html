<p style="text-align:justify">Emails are used for many things, although it is important to use it wisely. Spam and Phishing emails are a couple of the 
methods used to compromise systems. Phishing emails are emails in which the sender claims to be a reputable company, for example there has been an 
amazon phishing scam going around where people are getting email from someone claiming to be Amazon saying their account has been logged into by someone else. 
By clicking on the link and logging in you are essentially giving them your login information and thus access to your account. Emails like this have existed
for a long time and things like the infamous ILOVEYOU email have compromised systems worldwide.</p>

<ul style="background-color:white">
    <li>Always check and verify the senders email address</li><br>
    <li>Carefully read any links that may be in the email</li><br>
    <li>Check for any misspelled words</li><br>
    <li>Hover over files and check the left hand corner to see where they lead (Avoid .bat extensions)</li><br>
    <li>Only click links or download files from people you trust</li><br>
